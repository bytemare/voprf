* If there's no issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bytemare/voprf/issues/new). Please be clear in the title and description, and add relevant information. Bonus points if you provide a **code sample** and everything needed to reproduce the issue when expected behaviour is not occurring.
* If possible, use the relevant issue templates.
